# Standardization to DwC-A

##Alter the Diveboard "OBIS" standard in Darwin Core 

### Introduction

The OBIS standard is not a perfect fit for creating Darwin Core Archives. To resolve this problem we created some instructions to simply create a Darwin Core Archive, starting from the OBIS standard.

###The OBIS standard

A weblink to the current OBIS standard can be found here: [OBIS Schema](http://www.iobis.org/node/304)


### Changes to be made

* [Add fields](add-fields.md): Fields that are not available in the current "Diveboard" view, but are preferably added, many are fixed terms.
* [Change fields](change-fields.md): Fields available in the OBIS standard but requires a new header. A link to the Darwin Core standard can be found here: [Darwin Core Schema](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/)
* [Delete fields](delete-fields.md): Fields who can be deleted in the diveboard view.
