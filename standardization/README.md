# Standardization

## Changes to be made

* [Add fields](add-fields.md): Fields that are currently not provided, but which are preferably added. Many are fixed terms (= same value for all fields).
* [Change fields](change-fields.md): Fields that are currently provided, but which require a new header or some slight changes.
* [Delete fields](delete-fields.md): Fields that are currently provided, but which should be deleted, as these are empty or superfluous.

### Overview of DwC fields

* [DwC mapping](dwc-mapping.md): An overview of all Darwin Core terms and their relevance to the Diveboard data.
